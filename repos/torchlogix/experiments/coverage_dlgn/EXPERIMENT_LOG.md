# CoverageDLGN experiment history after the pre-experiment checkpoint

This log records operational failures and protocol decisions made after commit
`7332d91`. Raw run artifacts remain the source of truth for numerical results.

## July 24, 2026: Table 1 startup

- The first GPU check failed with `Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library
  version mismatch`: the loaded kernel module was 580.159.03 while the NVML
  userspace library was 580.173.
- PyTorch 2.9.0+cu130 could still enumerate both RTX PRO 6000 GPUs and complete
  a matrix multiplication, but no training was launched while the host state
  was inconsistent.
- The machine was restarted by the user. After restart, `nvidia-smi` and
  PyTorch both report driver 580.173.02, CUDA 13.0, two GPUs, and no active GPU
  workload.
- All Python commands use `repos/torchlogix/venv/bin/python`; no package was
  installed.
- CoverageDLGN v3 (`semantic_balanced_hybrid`) is frozen. Comparator work adds
  learnable-routing controls and architectures but does not change v3 topology
  construction or scoring.
- The search budget and Table 1 comparator adaptations are frozen in
  `experiment_manifest.json` before accuracy screening.
- The first Mommen and LILogicNet CUDA smokes revealed that TorchLogix's
  historical `--connections-gumbel` declaration used `store_false`, making
  Gumbel noise active when the option was omitted. Both papers use ordinary
  softmax routing. Those artifacts were classified as failed protocol checks,
  the parser was corrected to an explicit boolean option defaulting to false,
  and every comparator configuration now records `connections_gumbel: false`.
